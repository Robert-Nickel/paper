__Use this as a template for writing your paper. It will automatically build a cool HTML that contains all your citations like [here](https://robert-nickel.github.io/paper).__

1. Install [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) (prerequisite!)
2. Use this [repo as template](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template) (!= fork)
3. Copy `pre-commit` into your `.git/hooks` folder
4. Write your paper (in `paper.md`)
5. Add citations by adding
   1. the book/article/.. you cite in bibliography.bib
   2. [@citation_handle] in your text
6. Make a git commit. (The pre-commit hook will generate your HTML automatically.)

Optional steps:  
7. If you want to rename `paper.md`, rename it's reference in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` as well  
8. If you want to generate your HTML without commiting, execute `pandoc --citeproc paper.md --standalone -o index.html`  
9. If you want your paper to be accessible as a website, activate [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) by going to Settings -> GitHub Pages and selecting Master as source branch
